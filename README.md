# Machine Learning Analysis of College Admissions
This repository contains data and analysis from a specific university’s application office. 

## Data
Our dataset, `AdmissionsData.rdata` consists of 8700 observations that describe each applicant’s academic scores, personal background, and admissions decision. Specifically, there are 9 covariates including person’s SAT scores (verbal and math), ethnicity (anglo, asian, or black), weighted GPA, household income, sex, and admission decision.

## Analysis
The analysis is contained in [this notebook](notebooks/admissions-analysis.ipynb). We applied supervised machine learning methods to find a model that would accurately classify whether an applicant gets admitted to this college.
